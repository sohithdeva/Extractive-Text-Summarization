# Text-Extraction
The extractive text summarization technique involves pulling key phrases from the source document and combining them to make a summary. The extraction is made according to the defined metric without making any changes to the texts.
### I performed two extractive text summarization models:
1)	Extractive Text summarization by using Gensim
2)	Extractive Text summarization by using Spacy
